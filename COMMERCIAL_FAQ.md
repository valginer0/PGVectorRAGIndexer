## 2) Can my company evaluate PGVectorRAGIndexer for free?

Yes. Short-term evaluation and testing are allowed under the Community License,
including evaluation within a company, as long as it is limited to assessment and
not part of ongoing internal operations, production systems, or CI/CD workflows.

## 3) Is internal company use considered “commercial” even if we don’t sell it?

Yes. Ongoing internal use by a for-profit organization is considered Commercial Use,
even if the Software is not sold to customers.

---

## 4) Does using it in CI/CD require a commercial license?

Yes. CI/CD and automated workflows are considered Commercial Use.

---

## 5) Do I need a commercial license if I’m a consultant using it for a client?

Usually yes. If PGVectorRAGIndexer is being used to deliver value to a paying client,
or is integrated into client work, a commercial license is required. Please reach out
with your use case and scope.

## 6) Can we redistribute PGVectorRAGIndexer to customers or bundle it into our product?

Redistribution, OEM usage, or bundling into a product generally requires additional
terms and must be explicitly agreed in writing.

## 6a) I’m a software agency or consultant delivering a solution to a client. What license do I need?

If PGVectorRAGIndexer is used as part of a deliverable provided to a client
(even for a single project or internal deployment), this use case is **not**
covered by standard internal-use commercial licenses.

An **OEM / Agency License** is required.

OEM / Agency licenses are typically scoped to:
- a **single end client**
- a defined project or engagement
- non-transferable usage rights

Please contact valginer0@gmail.com with a brief description of the project
and deployment scope to discuss appropriate terms.

## 7) Can we run a hosted or managed service based on PGVectorRAGIndexer?

Hosted/managed service use cases typically require additional terms and must be
explicitly agreed in writing.

## 8) Does a commercial license include support or an SLA?

No. PGVectorRAGIndexer is provided as a self-service product.
Support, consulting, and SLAs are not included unless explicitly agreed in writing.

---

## 9) What information should we include when requesting a commercial license?

Please include:
- organization name
- approximate team size
- intended use (internal, production, CI/CD, hosted, etc.)
- estimated deployment scope
