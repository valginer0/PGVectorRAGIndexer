## OEM / Agency use

Some organizations (such as software agencies or integrators) may wish to use
PGVectorRAGIndexer as part of a deliverable provided to a client.

Examples include:
- building a custom internal RAG system for a client
- embedding PGVectorRAGIndexer into a client-specific deployment
- delivering a solution that includes PGVectorRAGIndexer as a component

These use cases are **not covered** by standard internal-use commercial licenses.

An **OEM / Agency License** is required and is typically scoped to:
- deployment for a **single end client**
- a defined project or engagement
- non-transferable usage rights

OEM / Agency licensing is handled on a case-by-case basis.
Please contact **valginer0@gmail.com** with a description of the project and scope.

## Pricing approach

Commercial license pricing is based on:

- organization size
- deployment scope
- usage context (internal, production, CI/CD, hosted, redistribution)

Typical annual pricing starts in the low hundreds of USD for small teams
and scales with organizational size and usage scope.

Pricing is intended to be fair, transparent, and proportionate to value.
One-time, annual, and custom terms are available depending on use case.
