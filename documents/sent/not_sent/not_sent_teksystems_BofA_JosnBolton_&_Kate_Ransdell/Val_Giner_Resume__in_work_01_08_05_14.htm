<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A web-based,</B> <B>real time risk-management application Gizmo</B> has been used by FX traders in the US, Europe, Japan and Latin America as the main risk management tool in their day to day activities.  It was developed in close communication with the traders on the trading floor, using the Agile Development methodology.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>
<LI>Several versions of Gizmo were developed and deployed into production. Each following version delivered richer functionality, better scalability, performance, extensibility and low maintenance requirements. All the upgrades were transparent for the users. The versions migrated from Software technology based on C++ CORBA back-end and Python/Apache CGI front-end to Java J2EE EJB under Weblogic back-end and Servlet/JSP/Struts front-end. Data was stored in Sybase and in Oracle databases. </LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>The system includes an analytical engine, web-based GUI, real-time data feeds (rate feeds from Reuters, deal feeds from the external trading systems and legacy systems).  It communicates with the Back Office (receives cash flow and positions adjustments caused by settlements specifics, such as changes in NOSTRO balances) and with the Middle Office (receives the official Citibank EOD rates for EOD P&amp;l evaluation). </LI>
<LI>The analytical engine was optimized for real time performance under the constraints of remote access in multi-user environment.</LI>
<LI>The application services had two kinds of public interfaces, an EJB session fa&ccedil;ade interface, and also expose their functionality as Web Services. The application has an ability to store data in an XML-based database rather than an RDBMS and to use XSLT/XPath instead of SQL for the queries.  Adapters to XML-based products (XML DBMS eXcelon, Tamino and Apache Xindice) were implemented.</LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Reviewed the architecture and participated in the design of the <B>real-time trading system OpenFX</B>.  Worked closely with the London based architecture team.  Designed patterns and interfaces for the services dealing with processing of the contracts, cash flow maintenance, managing different types of real-time and sanitized rates, real-time calculations, handling the communication of the real-time updates by the back-end to the GUI, etc. </P>
