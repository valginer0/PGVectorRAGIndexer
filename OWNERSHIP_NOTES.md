**To fully prevent pull requests, configure these settings:**

#### Disable Pull Requests (Optional)

2. Scroll to **Features** section
3. **Uncheck** "Issues" if you don't want issue tracking
4. Keep "Issues" checked if you want bug reports/suggestions
5. Note: GitHub doesn't allow disabling PRs, but you can:

   - Immediately close any PRs that are opened
   - Set branch protection rules

#### Branch Protection
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**

   - ‚úÖ Restrict who can push (only you)
