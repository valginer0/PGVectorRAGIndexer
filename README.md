### 🤔 In Plain English (What does this actually do?)

> **Imagine a magic bookshelf** that reads and understands every book, document, and note you put on it. When you have a question, you don't have to search for keywords yourself—you just ask the bookshelf in plain English (like "How do I fix the printer?" or "What was our revenue last year?"), and it instantly hands you the exact page with the answer.
>
> **Best of all? It lives 100% on your own hardware.** Your documents never get sent to the "cloud" or some stranger's server. Whether on your laptop or your company's server, your data stays yours.

Most search bars are dumb—they only find exact word matches. If you search for **"dog"**, they won't find **"puppy"**.

**This system is smart.** It reads your documents, understands the _meaning_ behind the text, and lets you search using natural language.

---

### 🔒 Designed for Trust, Not the Cloud

What this system does **not** do is just as important as what it does.

PGVectorRAGIndexer does **not** upload your documents to external services or rely on any external AI service.
Everything runs on your own infrastructure — your laptop for personal use, or your company's server for teams.

This design is intentional. It means:
- Your files never leave your infrastructure
- The application runtime requires no mandatory accounts, cloud subscriptions, or hidden data flows
- You can use it safely with personal, private, or sensitive documents

**Policy:** PGVectorRAGIndexer is local-only by design — your data stays on your hardware, and we do not offer hosted indexing or storage.

Unlike chat-based tools, this app focuses on **search and discovery**, not conversation.  
It helps you *find and rediscover* documents by meaning — even when you don’t remember the exact words.

---

### 🖥️ Choose Your Deployment

> **For teams and organizations, run PGVectorRAGIndexer on a shared server and connect Windows/macOS/Linux desktop clients remotely. No Docker needed on client machines.**

- **✅ Organization Console**: Full admin console for server-side governance — users, roles, permissions, retention, audit logs, API keys, and SCIM provisioning. Adapts to server capabilities with 4-state detection. Admin write operations: user CRUD, API key lifecycle (create/revoke/rotate), retention manual cleanup, and compliance export. Permission-aware gating matches backend authorization.
- **✅ Identity Endpoint (`GET /me`)**: Server returns the current user's identity, role, and resolved permissions. Loopback mode returns effective admin authority.
- **✅ Check for Updates**: Pulls latest app code (`git pull`) **and** Docker images in one click from the Settings tab.

### Recent Features (v2.7)

- **✅ License Validation Fixed**: Reverted incorrect public key update that caused valid RSA license signatures to be rejected.
- **✅ Deep Observability**: `JSONFormatter` for structured JSON logging, system metrics on `/health`.
- **✅ Desktop API Client Facade**: Decoupled monolithic `APIClient` into domain clients (`SystemClient`, `DocumentClient`, etc.).

### 🔐 Encrypted PDF Handling

Password-protected PDFs cannot be indexed without decryption. Instead of crashing or failing silently, PGVectorRAGIndexer handles them gracefully:

**How it works:**
1. When a password-protected PDF is encountered during upload, it's detected immediately
2. The file is skipped (not indexed) and added to a special "encrypted PDFs" list
3. Processing continues with the remaining files — one encrypted file won't stop your batch
4. You can review all encrypted PDFs after the upload completes

**Desktop App:**
- After upload, an **"🔒 Encrypted PDFs (N)"** button appears if any were detected
- Click to see a filterable list of all encrypted files with their paths
- You can copy paths or open the folder to manually decrypt files
- Re-upload the decrypted versions when ready

**API:**
- `GET /documents/encrypted` — List all encrypted PDFs encountered
- Upload returns `403` with `error_type: encrypted_pdf` for individual encrypted files

**CLI (Headless Mode):**
- Encrypted PDFs are logged to `encrypted_pdfs.log` for later review
- Processing continues without interruption

> **Note:** The app cannot decrypt PDFs for you — you'll need the password and a PDF tool to unlock them first.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Desktop App)
**This is the recommended way to use the app.** It gives you the full experience with the native interface.

> 🛡️ **Security note (public Wi-Fi)**
> If you use the app on public or shared Wi-Fi (cafés, airports, hotels), we recommend using a trusted network or a VPN.
> On a private home network, no special setup is needed.

> **Most users only need this guide.** The additional documents are for advanced deployment, customization, or maintenance scenarios.

### 🤖 AI Agent Integration (MCP)
**New in v2.3+**: You can connect desktop AI agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) directly to your local database using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

PGVectorRAGIndexer acts as a **local MCP tool provider** — it does not run an LLM,
but exposes your indexed documents as searchable tools to compatible AI agents.

**Why use this?**
- 🔒 **Zero network exposure**: Uses `stdio` pipes, so no ports are opened.
- 🧠 **Context-aware AI**: Your AI assistant can fuzzy-search your private documents to answer questions.

**Other compatible clients**
- Cursor (agent mode)
- Claude CLI
- Custom MCP-compatible agents

**Exposed MCP tools**
- `search_documents` — semantic / hybrid search over indexed files
- `index_document` — add or re-index documents
- `list_documents` — enumerate indexed sources

**Setup for Claude Desktop:**
1.  Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "local-rag": {
          "command": "/path/to/your/venv/bin/python",
          "args": ["/path/to/PGVectorRAGIndexer/mcp_server.py"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
2.  Restart Claude. You will see a 🔌 icon indicating the connection.
3.  Ask: *"Search my documents for 'financial report' and summarize the key points."*

### Database Management

#### Manual Database Inspection

Use the interactive database inspection tool:
```bash
./inspect_db.sh
```

Options include:
- List all documents
- Count chunks per document
- Show recent chunks
- Search for text in chunks
- Show database statistics
- List extensions
- Show table schema
- Interactive psql session
- Custom SQL query

#### Direct Database Access

```bash
# View all documents
docker exec vector_rag_db psql -U rag_user -d rag_vector_db -c \
  "SELECT DISTINCT document_id, source_uri, COUNT(*) as chunks 
   FROM document_chunks GROUP BY document_id, source_uri;"

# Search for text
docker exec vector_rag_db psql -U rag_user -d rag_vector_db -c \
  "SELECT document_id, LEFT(text_content, 100) 
   FROM document_chunks WHERE text_content ILIKE '%search_term%';"

# Get statistics
docker exec vector_rag_db psql -U rag_user -d rag_vector_db -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT document_id) as docs, COUNT(*) as chunks 
   FROM document_chunks;"
```

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Hybrid Search

Combine vector similarity with full-text search for better results:

```python
# CLI
python retriever_v2.py "query" --hybrid --alpha 0.7

# API
{
  "query": "machine learning",
  "use_hybrid": true,
  "alpha": 0.7  # 0.7 vector + 0.3 full-text
}
```

**v2.2.4+ Improvements:**
- **Optimized for Large Databases**: Scales to 150K+ chunks efficiently
- **Exact-Match Boost**: Full-text matches are automatically boosted to top of results
- **Phrase Support**: Mix quoted and unquoted terms in your search:
  ```
  Master Card "Simplicity 9112"
  ```
  Quoted subphrases (`"Simplicity 9112"`) must match as adjacent words; other terms (`Master Card`) are matched individually.

### Metadata Filtering

Add and filter by custom metadata:

```python
# Index with metadata
{
  "source_uri": "/path/to/doc.pdf",
  "metadata": {
    "author": "John Doe",
    "category": "research",
    "year": 2024
  }
}

# Search with filters
{
  "query": "neural networks",
  "filters": {
    "document_id": "abc123"
  }
}
```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple documents efficiently:

```python
from indexer_v2 import DocumentIndexer

indexer = DocumentIndexer()
results = indexer.index_batch([
    "/path/to/doc1.pdf",
    "/path/to/doc2.pdf",
    "https://example.com/article"
])
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Database Tuning

For production, consider these PostgreSQL settings:

```sql
-- Increase work memory for vector operations
SET work_mem = '256MB';

-- Tune HNSW index parameters
CREATE INDEX ON document_chunks USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 32, ef_construction = 128);  -- Higher values = better recall, slower build
```

### Embedding Cache

The system caches embeddings in memory. Monitor cache size:

```python
from embeddings import get_embedding_service

service = get_embedding_service()
print(f"Cache size: {service.get_cache_size()}")
service.clear_cache()  # Clear if needed
```

### Connection Pooling

Adjust pool size based on workload:

```bash
DB_POOL_SIZE=20
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=40
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Database Credentials**: Store in `.env` file (gitignored)
2. **API Authentication**: Add authentication middleware for production
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated via Pydantic
4. **SQL Injection**: Protected via parameterized queries
5. **File Upload**: Validate file types and sizes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

## 📈 Monitoring

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
bash scripts/run_all_tests.sh
```

### Run Specific Test Categories

```bash
# Unit tests only
pytest -m unit

# Integration tests
pytest -m integration

# With coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Testing Rules

- **Write tests first**: For each bug or feature, add or update tests before changing code.
- **Separate test database**: Tests run against `rag_vector_db_test` to avoid polluting development data. This is configured in `tests/conftest.py`.
- **No manual installs**: Do not run `pip install <pkg>`. Always add dependencies to `requirements.txt` and install via `pip install -r requirements.txt` for reproducibility.

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Main table with enhanced features
CREATE TABLE document_chunks (
    chunk_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    document_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    chunk_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
    text_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    source_uri TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding VECTOR(384),
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    indexed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(document_id, chunk_index)
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding_hnsw ON document_chunks 
    USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_text_search ON document_chunks 
    USING gin(to_tsvector('english', text_content));
CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_metadata ON document_chunks 
    USING gin(metadata);
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation
- **Factory Pattern**: Service instantiation
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global configuration and services
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable document loaders


## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Database Tuning

For production, consider these PostgreSQL settings:

```sql
-- Increase work memory for vector operations
SET work_mem = '256MB';

-- Tune HNSW index parameters
CREATE INDEX ON document_chunks USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 32, ef_construction = 128);  -- Higher values = better recall, slower build
```

### Embedding Cache

The system caches embeddings in memory. Monitor cache size:

```python
from embeddings import get_embedding_service

service = get_embedding_service()
print(f"Cache size: {service.get_cache_size()}")
service.clear_cache()  # Clear if needed
```

### Connection Pooling

Adjust pool size based on workload:

```bash
DB_POOL_SIZE=20
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=40
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Database Credentials**: Store in `.env` file (gitignored)
2. **API Authentication**: Add authentication middleware for production
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated via Pydantic
4. **SQL Injection**: Protected via parameterized queries
5. **File Upload**: Validate file types and sizes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# Check logs
docker logs vector_rag_db

# Restart container
docker compose restart
```

### Import Errors

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Memory Issues

```bash
# Clear embedding cache
python -c "from embeddings import get_embedding_service; get_embedding_service().clear_cache()"

# Reduce batch size
export EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=16
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Health Checks

```bash
# CLI
python indexer_v2.py stats

# API
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Database Statistics

```sql
-- View document statistics
SELECT * FROM document_stats;

-- Check index usage
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Database size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));
```

## 🔄 Migration from v1

The v2 system is backward compatible with v1 data. To migrate:

1. **Backup existing data**:
```bash
docker exec vector_rag_db pg_dump -U rag_user rag_vector_db > backup.sql
```

2. **Update schema**:
```bash
docker exec -i vector_rag_db psql -U rag_user -d rag_vector_db < init-db.sql
```

3. **Use new CLI**:
```bash
# Old: python indexer.py document.pdf
# New: python indexer_v2.py index document.pdf
```

## 📝 Development

### Code Style

```bash
# Format code

# Lint code
ruff check .

# Type checking
mypy .
```

### Adding New Document Loaders

Extend `DocumentLoader` class in `document_processor.py`:

```python
class CustomLoader(DocumentLoader):
    def can_load(self, source_uri: str) -> bool:
        return source_uri.endswith('.custom')
    
    def load(self, source_uri: str) -> List[Document]:
        # Your loading logic
        pass
```
