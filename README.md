# PGVectorRAGIndexer
A robust local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project designed to turn PostgreSQL into a high-performance vector database using the pgvector extension. This tool indexes documents from diverse sources (local files, URLs, cloud drives) and allows for contextual, semantic search across the entire corpus.
