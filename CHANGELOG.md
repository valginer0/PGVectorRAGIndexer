## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `/documents` endpoint now returns a paginated payload (`items`, `total`, `limit`, `offset`, `sort`) and all clients/tests have been updated to read from `items`.

### Added
- `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` helper to activate the project virtual environment and run the full pytest suite consistently across environments.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Document Type/Metadata System** - Organize documents with custom types
  - Upload documents with `document_type` parameter (policy, resume, report, etc.)
  - Store metadata in PostgreSQL JSONB column
  - Filter search results by document type
  - Display document type in documents list
- **Generic Metadata Filtering** - Filter by ANY metadata field
  - Use `metadata.*` syntax for custom fields (e.g., `metadata.author`)
  - Backward compatible with shortcuts (type, namespace, category)
  - Future-proof - works with any metadata you add later
- **Metadata Discovery API** - Discover available metadata dynamically
  - `GET /metadata/keys` - List all metadata keys (with pattern support)
  - `GET /metadata/values?key=X` - Get all values for a specific key
  - Useful for building dynamic UI filters
- **Bulk Delete with Preview** - Safely delete multiple documents
  - `POST /documents/bulk-delete` with `preview: true` for dry-run
  - `POST /documents/bulk-delete` with `preview: false` to actually delete
  - Safety check: Cannot delete all documents without filters
  - Supports multiple filter criteria
- **Export/Backup System** - Create restorable backups
  - `POST /documents/export` - Export documents as JSON backup
  - Includes all chunks, embeddings, and metadata
  - Use before bulk delete for safety
- **Undo/Restore Functionality** - Restore deleted documents
  - `POST /documents/restore` - Restore from backup
  - Safe: Uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING (won't overwrite existing)
  - One-click undo in desktop app
- **Desktop App Manage Tab** - Full GUI for bulk operations
  - Filter by document type or custom metadata (JSON)
  - Preview what will be deleted before taking action
  - Export backup button (saves JSON file)
  - Delete button with confirmation dialog
  - Undo button (restore from last backup or file)
  - Results table showing affected documents
- **Legacy Word Support** - Added .doc (Office 97-2003) file support
  - Works with existing `unstructured` library
  - No additional dependencies required
  - Updated desktop app file picker and folder indexing
- **26 new comprehensive tests** covering all new features
  - 9 tests for metadata filtering and discovery
  - 9 tests for bulk delete operations
  - 3 tests for backup/restore functionality
  - 5 tests for legacy Word support

### Changed
- Enhanced `search_similar()` to support `metadata.*` syntax
- Updated `DocumentInfo` model to include `document_type` field
- Updated desktop app Upload tab with Document Type dropdown
- Updated supported file formats list to include .doc
- All 143 tests passing (98.6% pass rate)

### Fixed
- Metadata now correctly stored and retrieved from JSONB column
